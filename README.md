# Fraud-Transaction-Detection-Using-Machine-learning-Data-Science-Project-

Data Quality: Enhanced data quality by handling missing values and implementing the Interquartile Range
(IQR) method to cap outliers. Addressed multicollinearity using the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF).
Model & Methodology: Developed a machine learning solution to detect fraud. Used SMOTE (Synthetic
Minority Over-sampling Technique) to handle class imbalance. Trained and evaluated four models, including
XGBoost and LightGBM, with LightGBM achieving the highest performance.
 Insights & Strategy: Identified key fraud predictors, such as transaction type (TRANSFER, CASH_OUT)
and large balance changes (diff_balance_org). Proposed a strategic prevention plan for infrastructure updates,
including real-time monitoring, a tiered alerting system, and a framework for measuring success.
